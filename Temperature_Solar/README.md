# Temperature

Version 4 - Removed solar. Not needed anymore in this setup because I am moved to a new house.

* Arduino Uno v3
* Ethernet Shield
* TM1637 4bit 7 segments module
* Reads from a DS18S20 temperature sensor
* Writes data to MySQL database
* Data is then used from a website.


Actualy it needs a smaller footprint. There is not much memory left in the Arduino. So if anyone have suggestions, youre welcome :)
