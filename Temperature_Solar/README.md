# Temperature & Solar

* Arduino Uno v3
* Ethernet Shield
* Reads from a DS18S20 temperature sensor
* Reads Unixtime from NTP Server
* Reads Solar value
* Writes data to MySQL database
* Data is then used from a website.


Actualy it needs a smaller footprint. There is not much memory left in the Arduino. So if anyone have suggestions, youre welcome :)
